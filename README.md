## libsass

Keep in mind that libsass is feature-wise not fully compatible with Ruby Sass. Check out [this](http://sass-compatibility.github.io) curated list of incompatibilities to find out which features are missing.

If your favorite feature is missing and you really need Ruby Sass, you can always switch to [gulp-ruby-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass) and update the `styles` task in gulpfile accordingly.
